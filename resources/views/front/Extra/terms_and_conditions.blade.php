                            <h3 class="h3-title">understanding and defining scope of work</h3>
                            <p>Clarity and transparency in the technical development scope is what we always request and
                                work hard to achieve. For promising projects we do not mind having multiple sessions through
                                Skype, video or email to get a complete picture of the work we are suppose to do. The more
                                information we have from you it's better to get projects executed successfully. Ideally we
                                need designs for all pages and technical specifications of functionality customization. We
                                will present our understanding to you once we have sufficient understanding of the project.
                                Please note that anything outside the presented statement of work will be considered as
                                Change Request as per our terms and conditions. We will strictly follow the list of tasks as
                                agreed. We are purely focussed on technical website development. We do not consider front
                                end concept design in our scope of work. We can convert PSD design file to HTML or
                                e-commerce or CMS website theme but would need completely well described PSD files.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3-title">development environment</h3>
                            <p>All the development will take place on staging server set up by Empyreal Infotech. We will
                                update client based on the milestones set up. This will be done by sharing link to our dev
                                server. Please provide feedback only when requested by our team. If client points or lists
                                out issues during development even though our team is still working, those points are likely
                                to be not addressed or if we are pressurized to work on them it will be considered as Change
                                Request and charged extra. We request clients to co-operate and do review once we finish all
                                the work including testing.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3-title">strict adherence to scope of work</h3>
                            <p>Our team will strictly follow the scope of work mutually agreed between us and client.</p>
                            <p>Please note that any changes in designs or functionality would need to be clarified upfront.
                                We will not be in position to work on any small or big issues with assumptions. Clients are
                                requested to not to pressurize team to get task or work done on the basis that particular
                                functionality or change needs to be understood. We request clients to clarify complete scope
                                of work with 100% clarity in designs and functional specification.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3-title">project confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement</h3>
                            <p>Empyreal Infotech takes full responsibility of keeping all client information including
                                contact details and project information very much confidential. Our client keeps complete
                                ownership of the project we work for them. We will not be contacting any of the end
                                customers without permission from our client.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3-title">quality control and support for bug fixing</h3>
                            <p>Our team has a dedicated QA for functionality testing and design matching. This will depend
                                on the scope of work. We generally check in IE7+, Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. If you
                                need testing to be done in specific devise or version, it needs to be discussed upfront.
                                Otherwise it will be considered as change request and payment will be charged on actual time
                                taken basis as per our hourly rate.</p>
                            <p>We give 2 months bug fixing guarantee post delivery of work and project sign off. It will be
                                responsibility of Empyreal Infotech's team to fix any issues or bugs within the scope of
                                work and we will try to address this at earliest.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3-title">communication and response time</h3>
                            <p>Our team normally prefers to communicate any project related discussion through email or
                                Skype. Generally there will be a dedicated project manager looking after the production of
                                project and doing all communication. We request clients to let us know in advance if you
                                want to set up project discussion meeting rather than chatting on Skype at any point of
                                time. This ensures that we are fully prepared to discuss with you dedicatedly as there are
                                lots of other project we have in production. We would respond to any emails or Skype request
                                at earliest possible normally within 1 day. Delivery of the task will depend on team
                                availability. We will let you know when you can expect project or task delivery. If our team
                                has any queries related to project, we request clients to reply to us at earliest. If there
                                are delays in this, it will affect delivery timeline.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3-title">timeline and delays</h3>
                            <p>We would let our clients know in advance realistic timeline for development. We would avoid
                                falling into conflict of agreeing on quicker unrealistic timeline if our team is not
                                confident within the time frame you anticipate tasks or projects to be completed. Our
                                commitment to deliver on agreed timeline will only be valid if we get all requested
                                information, payments and feedback on time. Delay in any project related information or
                                payments will cause delay in project execution. We may also transfer our resources on other
                                project which may affect attending your project requests on urgent basis.</p>
                            <h3 class="h3-title">payment terms</h3>
                            <p>All our projects require advance payment before we start development. The amount of advance
                                payment is informed to client and is based on the size of project. For those projects where
                                payments are split into more that 2 halves, we would need payments to be cleared at each
                                milestone as agreed. Violation of this by client will lead to ceasing of further project
                                progress by our team and cause unnecessary delay until we have payments cleared on time as
                                agreed.</p>
                            <p>We accept Payments through PayPal or Bank Wire Transfer to our bank account in India. All
                                account details are clearly mentioned in the invoice copy we send to our client.</p>

                            <p>As per agreed payment terms, our clients will be required to make payments on time in order
                                to start, continue or complete development. Clients are requested to ensure that we receive
                                funds in our accounts on time as per the agreement. Delay in making payments may result in
                                delay in project delivery, project getting put on hold or complete stop of work until funds
                                are cleared. Our team will not transfer any code without mutual agreement and receipt of
                                payments. If development is requested on client server, we would need 100% upfront payments.
                                We will not tolerate urgency to transfer the code without us receiving payments.</p>
